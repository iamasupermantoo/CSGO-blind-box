在信息使用时，例如信息展示、信息关联计算，我们会采用多种数据脱敏技术增强信息在使用中安全性。采用严格的数据访问权限控制和多重身份认证技术保护信息，避免数据被违规使用。<br>\r\n（二）我们为保护信息采取的其他安全措施<br>\r\n我们通过建立数据分类分级制度、数据安全管理规范、数据安全开发规范来管理规范信息的存储和使用。<br>\r\n我们通过信息接触者保密协议、监控和审计机制来对数据进行全面安全控制。<br>\r\n加强安全意识。我们还会举办安全和隐私保护培训课程，加强员工对于保护信息重要性的认识。<br>\r\n（三）我们仅允许有必要知晓这些信息的www.gosking.net员工、合作伙伴访问您的信息，并为此设置了严格的访问权限控制和监控机制。我们同时要求可能接触到您的信息的所有人员履行相应的保密义务。如果未能履行这些义务，可能会被追究法律责任或被中止与www.gosking.net的合作关系。<br>\r\n（四）我们会采取一切合理可行的措施，确保未收集无关的信息。<br>\r\n（五）互联网并非绝对安全的环境，而且电子邮件、即时通讯、社交软件或其他服务软件等与其他用户的交流方式无法确定是否完全加密，我们建议您使用此类工具时请使用复杂密码，并注意保护您的信息安全。<br>\r\n（六）互联网环境并非百分之百安全，我们将尽力确保或担保您发送给我们的任何信息的安全性。如果我们的物理、技术、或管理防护设施遭到破坏，导致信息被非授权访问、公开披露、篡改、或毁坏，导致您的合法权益受损，我们将承担相应的法律责任。<br>\r\n（七）安全事件处置<br>\r\n在通过www.gosking.net服务与第三方进行沟通或购买商品及服务时，您不可避免的要向交易对方或潜在的交易对方披露自己的信息，如联络方式或者邮政地址等。请您妥善保护自己的信息，仅在必要的情形下向他人提供。<br>\r\n为应对信息泄露、损毁和丢失等可能出现的风险，我们制定了多项制度，明确安全事件、安全漏洞的分类分级标准及相应的处理流程。我们也为安全事件建立了专门的应急响应团队，按照安全事件处置规范要求，针对不同安全事件启动安全预案，进行止损、分析、定位、制定补救措施、联合相关部门进行溯源和打击。<br>\r\n在不幸发生信息安全事件后，我们将按照法律法规的要求，及时向您告知：安全事件的基本情况和可能的影响、我们已采取或将要采取的处置措施、您可自主防范和降低风险的建议、对您的补救措施等。我们同时将及时将事件相关情况以邮件、信函、电话、推送通知等方式告知您，难以逐一告知信息主体时，我们会采取合理、有效的方式发布公告。同时，我们还将按照监管部门要求，主动上报信息安全事件的处置情况。<br>\r\n请您理解，由于技术的限制以及风险防范的局限，即便我们已经尽量加强安全措施，也无法始终保证信息百分之百的安全。您需要了解，您接入www.gosking.net服务所用的系统和通讯网络，有可能因我们可控范围外的情况而发生问题。<br>\r\n五、如何联系我们<br>\r\n如您有关于网络信息安全的投诉和举报，或您对本《隐私政策》、您的信息的相关事宜有任何问题、意见或建议，以及有关本声明或www.gosking.net的隐私措施的问题请与www.gosking.net的协调人联系。</div><br>\r\n
